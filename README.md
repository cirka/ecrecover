A Proof of Concentp OTP application to access to recoverable sign and recovery in libsecp256k1.
It works for me. It may not work for you. I do not provide support for included code.

Build
-----

You need Linux environment, git, autotools, make, erlang runtime, rebar3 and other tools I forgot I have installed in my env.

    $ rebar3 compile
